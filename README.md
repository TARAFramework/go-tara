Welcome to the implementation of TARA Framework in go language!  
This reference implementation is heavy WIP.  
Please use it with due considerations.

## TARA CLI (PoC)

### Installation

1. Get the go-tara repo
  
   ``` sh
   go get github.com/TARAFramework/go-tara
   ```

2. Enter the go-tara repo in your $GOPATH/src
  
   ``` sh
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TARAFramework/go-tara/
   ```

3. Run make for the executable
  
   ``` sh
   make go-tara
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to `go-tara` repo as discussed above
  
2. Open 3 terminals & execute the following commands one for each:
  
   ``` sh
    ./go-tara -nodeid 1
   ```
  
   ``` sh
    ./go-tara -nodeid 2
   ```
  
   ``` sh
    ./go-tara -nodeid 3
   ```

### Inputs

1. The buffer will open on the terminal console for your inputs.
  
2. *If inputs end with a '?' character*, the client request is relayed to `Cluster 1` encoded by its key ID 100.
  
3. *If inputs **do not** end with a '?' character*, the client request is relayed to `Cluster 2` encoded by its key ID 101.

<!-- //TODO: ### Customizability -->
